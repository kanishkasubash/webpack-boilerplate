# Webpack Boilerplate

Creating a Webpack boilerplate for an HTML, SCSS, and JS project involves configuring Webpack to bundle your SCSS and JS files, and generating an HTML file to include your styles and scripts.

**Prerequisites:**
Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

**Build and Run**

Now you can build and run your project using the following commands:

- Development (with live reload):
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- Production (optimized):
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

Your compiled and bundled HTML, CSS, and JS files will be placed in a `dist` directory in your project's root. You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see your project in action.

This is a basic boilerplate to get you started. You can further customize and expand your project by adding more loaders, plugins, and configurations to suit your specific needs.
