        <h1>Webpack Boilerplate for HTML, SCSS, and JS</h1>
        <p>Creating a Webpack boilerplate for an HTML, SCSS, and JS project involves configuring Webpack to bundle your
            SCSS and JS files, and generating an HTML file to include your styles and scripts.</p>
        <h2>Github Repository</h2>

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.</p>
        <h2>Build and Run</h2>
        <p>Now you can build and run your project using the following commands:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Development (with live reload):
                <pre>npm start</pre>
            </li>
            <li> Development (with live reload):
                <pre>npm run build</pre>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your compiled and bundled HTML, CSS, and JS files will be placed in a <code>dist</code> directory in your
            project's root. You can open the <code>index.html</code> file in your browser to see your project in action.
        </p>
        <p>This is a basic boilerplate to get you started. You can further customize and expand your project by adding
            more loaders, plugins, and configurations to suit your specific needs.</p>
